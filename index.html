                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p >

                        The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into science has disrupted almost every domain,
                        from accelerating the discovery of new materials to inspiring innovation in solutions to critical problems.
                        In less than a decade, the synergy of AI with chemistry and materials 
                        science has gained significant momentum in challenging tasks, such as exploring the chemical compound space, 
                        revealing complex patterns in atomistic models, accelerating simulations, 
                        or predicting the properties of experimentaly unknown molecules. 
                
                        This has lead to an increase in publications every year and emerging new peer-reviewed
                        journals focused on this topic.
                    </p>

                    <p >We are organizing a virtual hands-on training series to create a common ground in the
                        chemistry and materials science community to discuss and learn basic elements of AI/ML, and prepare the
                        participants to identify opportunities for adoption of this technology. Overall, this workshop
                        would foster the discussion of AI/ML within ANL and with external collaborators, and, more importantly, spark new inter
                        divisional collaborations. This workshop would promote teamwork by solving small projects in groups.
                        This workshop would be divided into about 6 presentations during the summer of 2023.
                        Each lecture would be composed of an introductory presentation and a hands-on session, for approximately 90 min. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main difference with other similar events, is that this will have demonstrations for 
			    using codes and share ideas on how to transfer this knowledge to related projects and ongoing research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The target audience would be domain experts with beginner and intermediate level of
                        experience in data science and programming. The lectures would be self-contained and could be
                        followed on Google Colab and jupyter.alcf.anl.gov platforms. This workshop seeks to
                        supplement other ALCF workshops, but ours has a focus on chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p><b>Title:</b> End-to-end AI Framework for Interpretable Prediction of Molecular and Crystal Properties</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk, I will target audience who are interested in understanding the basics of how to train, perform hyperparameter search and infer an ML model for molecular structures such as small molecules or MOFs. Moreover, with a bit of Python programming knowledge, my AI framework can help users who want to learn how to visualize learned molecular representations and highlight atoms important for prediction. I also demonstrate how ML potential can be used to perform molecular dynamics (MD). Overall, the audience can expect to learn comprehensive ML techniques developed and applied for molecular studies.

            <p><b>Title:</b> Emergent autonomous scientific research capabilities of large language models</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk, we will discuss an intelligent agent system that integrates multiple large language models for autonomous design, planning, and execution of scientific experiments. We will demonstrate the Agent's scientific research abilities using several examples, with the most complex one involving the successful execution of catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Lastly, we address the safety concerns related to such systems and suggest measures to prevent their potential misuse.

            <p><b>Title:</b> Deep learning of reaction properties via graph-convolutional neural nets</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
                Machine learning models are very successful in predicting various chemical properties. Graph-convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) are routinely used for the prediction of molecular properties, but their application to chemical reactions is largely unexplored. GCNNs allow for a learned extraction of important characteristics of a molecule and enable end-to-end learning, instead of relying on expert, system-dependent knowledge. However, the properties of chemical reactions, i.e. the combination of reactant and product molecules, are not readily accessible with current GCNNs which are designed to take molecular graphs as input. Recently, GCNNs based on the condensed graph of reaction (CGR) were shown to unlock the full potential of GCNNs also for reactions, where reactants and products are merged into a single pseudo-molecular graph, i.e. an artificial graph transition state. In this workshop, the anatomy of molecular GCNNs will be discussed in detail, as well as the changes necessary to encode reactions instead of molecules, including hands-on exercises to build your own reaction GCNN. Compared to previous approaches, GCNNs on CGRs offer a comparable or better performance with a lower number of parameters. We showcase the performance on different tasks, such as the prediction of barrier heights or rate constants, as well as the chemo- and regioselectivity of reactions.

<p><b>Bio:</b> 
    Esther Heid obtained her Bachelor’s (2014), Master’s (2016) and PhD (2019) degree in Chemistry from the  University of Vienna, Austria. Her thesis focused on the molecular dynamics simulation of soft matter, as well as quantum mechanical calculations for obtaining force field parameters. In 2020 she joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, holding an Erwin-Schroedinger Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Austrian Science Fund, which enables her to conduct research on the development of computer-aided tools for finding novel multi-enzyme networks which yield a specified target molecule. The project utilizes recent developments in machine learning, bioretrosynthesis, and cheminformatics, and aims toward a more efficient, selective and environmentally favorable synthesis of compounds through the inclusion of biocatalytic transformations. A major part of the project is concerned with developing new machine learning methods for molecular and reaction property predictions. Her postdoc fellowship includes a one-year return-phase in Austria to finish up the project, which she started in 2022 at the Vienna University of Technology.

                        All attendees, speakers, and sponsors, at the AI4ChemMat Hands-On Series and any

                    <p>Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are
                        expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe
                        environment for everybody: Be excellent to each other, show empathy,

                        AI4ChemMat Hands-On Series is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
                        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,
                        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, experience,
                        or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of meeting
                        participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to any
                        inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics
                        such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
                        expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability
                        status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law.
                        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                        immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop
                        organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
                        offender, expulsion from the workshop, notification to employers or academic
                        institutions, and authorities.
                        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
                        have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Organizing Committee
                        immediately and/or write to cps.chemmat@anl.gov with
                        Subject: BEHAVIOR COMPLAINT, take any evidence that might be useful, and if
                        this is not possible, do not worry and do not hesitate on warning the
                        organizers.
