                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p >

                        The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into science has disrupted almost every domain,
                        from accelerating the discovery of new materials to inspiring innovation in solutions to critical problems.
                        In less than a decade, the synergy of AI with chemistry and materials 
                        science has gained significant momentum in challenging tasks, such as exploring the chemical compound space, 
                        revealing complex patterns in atomistic models, accelerating simulations, 
                        or predicting the properties of experimentaly unknown molecules. 
                
                        This has lead to an increase in publications every year and emerging new peer-reviewed
                        journals focused on this topic.
                    </p>

                    <p >We are organizing a virtual hands-on training series to create a common ground in the
                        chemistry and materials science community to discuss and learn basic elements of AI/ML, and prepare the
                        participants to identify opportunities for adoption of this technology. Overall, this workshop
                        would foster the discussion of AI/ML within ANL and with external collaborators, and, more importantly, spark new inter
                        divisional collaborations. This workshop would promote teamwork by solving small projects in groups.
                        This workshop would be divided into about 6 presentations during the summer of 2023.
                        Each lecture would be composed of an introductory presentation and a hands-on session, for approximately 90 min. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main difference with other similar events, is that this will have demonstrations for 
			    using codes and share ideas on how to transfer this knowledge to related projects and ongoing research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The target audience would be domain experts with beginner and intermediate level of
                        experience in data science and programming. The lectures would be self-contained and could be
                        followed on Google Colab and jupyter.alcf.anl.gov platforms. This workshop seeks to
                        supplement other ALCF workshops, but ours has a focus on chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p><b>Title:</b> Deep learning of reaction properties via graph-convolutional neural nets</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
                Machine learning models are very successful in predicting various chemical properties. Graph-convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) are routinely used for the prediction of molecular properties, but their application to chemical reactions is largely unexplored. GCNNs allow for a learned extraction of important characteristics of a molecule and enable end-to-end learning, instead of relying on expert, system-dependent knowledge. However, the properties of chemical reactions, i.e. the combination of reactant and product molecules, are not readily accessible with current GCNNs which are designed to take molecular graphs as input. Recently, GCNNs based on the condensed graph of reaction (CGR) were shown to unlock the full potential of GCNNs also for reactions, where reactants and products are merged into a single pseudo-molecular graph, i.e. an artificial graph transition state. In this workshop, the anatomy of molecular GCNNs will be discussed in detail, as well as the changes necessary to encode reactions instead of molecules, including hands-on exercises to build your own reaction GCNN. Compared to previous approaches, GCNNs on CGRs offer a comparable or better performance with a lower number of parameters. We showcase the performance on different tasks, such as the prediction of barrier heights or rate constants, as well as the chemo- and regioselectivity of reactions.

    Esther Heid obtained her Bachelor’s (2014), Master’s (2016) and PhD (2019) degree in Chemistry from the  University of Vienna, Austria. Her thesis focused on the molecular dynamics simulation of soft matter, as well as quantum mechanical calculations for obtaining force field parameters. In 2020 she joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, holding an Erwin-Schroedinger Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Austrian Science Fund, which enables her to conduct research on the development of computer-aided tools for finding novel multi-enzyme networks which yield a specified target molecule. The project utilizes recent developments in machine learning, bioretrosynthesis, and cheminformatics, and aims toward a more efficient, selective and environmentally favorable synthesis of compounds through the inclusion of biocatalytic transformations. A major part of the project is concerned with developing new machine learning methods for molecular and reaction property predictions. Her postdoc fellowship includes a one-year return-phase in Austria to finish up the project, which she started in 2022 at the Vienna University of Technology.

                Machine Learning Force Fields for Heterogeneous Catalysis
            </p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		    Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are set to become an indispensable tool in computational catalysis. In this talk, we provide a detailed walkthrough on how to train an MLFF to accurately predict energy barriers for catalytic reaction pathways. We demonstrate the capabilities of the resulting interatomic potential that offers near ab-initio accuracy at a fraction of the cost. Specifically, we illustrate that MLFFs not only speed up routine catalytic tasks by orders of magnitude but also allow for a more realistic treatment of catalytic systems, identifying lower energy barriers and capturing finite temperature effects. We also present a Jupyter notebook that highlights the simplicity of training a state-of-the-art many-body equivariant graph neural network, namely MACE. The capacity of MLFFs to deepen our understanding of extensively studied catalysts emphasizes the importance of fast and accurate alternatives to direct ab-initio simulations. Automated training procedures are paramount in enhancing the accessibility of MLFFs for both academic and industrial applications, and for effective use of HPC resources.

                Structure determination of nanoscale materials using theory and experimental characterization data
            </p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		    The atomistic structure determines the stability and properties of a material and its potential use in applications. We develop software tools such as Ingrained and FANTASTX (Fully Automated Nanoscale To Atomistic Structure from Theory and eXperiments) to find the atomistic structure from experimental data. Ingrained software can construct a grain boundary structure or a surface structure based on the experimentally obtained TEM or STM images, respectively. And FANTASTX is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that helps find the thermodynamically or kinetically stabilized structures observed experimentally. In this talk, we will show examples of – the Ingrained-STM simulation tool with (111) Cu2O and CdTe grain boundary structures created using Ingrained-TEM. We also show the FANTASTX tool to search for the tellurene atomistic structure at the interface of CdTe grain boundary system. These tools provide a path to understand complex mechanisms in experimental systems using theory and further allow to tailor the local structure to the required effect.

                Extracting and utilizing multimodal datasets of images and text with large language models   
            </p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		    
		    With the recent exponential growth in publication rates, it has become impossible for a scientist to keep up with all publications related to a specific topic. Although there are notable efforts to automate text parsing from literature, there are many instances where important information is communicated through images or tables in papers.1 In this talk, I will present the latest developments in two software tools developed at the Center of Nanoscale Materials (CNM): i) EXSCLAIM! for data mining from scientific literature2, and ii) Plot2Spectra for image segmentation related to spectral images, with the aim of creating metadata.3 EXSCLAIM! has been enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., ChatGPT and appropriate prompt engineering to extract image-text pairs from scientific journals, which can be foundational for creating multimodal models and advancing semantic searches. In this presentation, I will demonstrate various applications of the extracted multimodal datasets in building knowledge graphs, conducting semantic searches, and performing topic modelling. Additionally, I will illustrate how to utilize the image segmentation workflow in Plot2Spectra to extract additional metadata and create datasets suitable for machine learning (ML) and high-throughput experimentation.

                        AI4ChemMat Hands-On Series is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
                        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,

                        or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of meeting
                        participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to any
                        inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics
                        such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender

                        status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law.
                        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                        immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop
                        organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
                        offender, expulsion from the workshop, notification to employers or academic
                        institutions, and authorities.
                        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
                        have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Organizing Committee
                        immediately and/or write to cps.chemmat@anl.gov with
                        Subject: BEHAVIOR COMPLAINT, take any evidence that might be useful, and if
                        this is not possible, do not worry and do not hesitate on warning the
                        organizers.
